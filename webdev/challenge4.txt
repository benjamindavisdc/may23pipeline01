I spent quite a bit of time trying to make it to where the most recent action was highlighted in gold. 

const lines = data.split('\n');
                const lastLine = lines[lines.length-1];
                //splitting and modifying data streams is brain melting work
                game.innerHTML = game.innerHTML.replace(lastLine, `<span class="last-line">${lastLine}</span>`);
                //YOU HAVE TO USE `BACK TICKS` when using replace!!

I could make the initial paragraph end in gold.

But then every successive input stayed gold, because the <span> tag was baked into the old actions.

The only solution I could manage required regenerating the entire text block every action to render the gold color. That seemed like it would get intensive for a large text file like AID, so I scrapped that feature. Oh well.
